A collection of my personal projects. 

**Fantasy Draft Generator**\
This app allows users to create their own fantasy drafts, with customizable drafters, picks and number of rounds.
It further allows multiple users on the same server to sign in using a given draft's code and participate in or spectate the draft.

**Geometric Art Generator**\
This app lets clients create, save and edit geometric art by repeatedly breaking up a square into quadrants and customizing their respective colors. 

**Weather App**\
This app displays real-time weather information at the client's geolocation, while also letting them get current weather data about any city in the world.
