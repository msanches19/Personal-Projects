A collection of my personal projects.

**AI Chess Engine**\
A chess game that allows users to play and review their games against a local opponent or an AI engine. 

**Fantasy Draft Generator**\
This app allows users to create their own fantasy drafts, with customizable drafters, picks and number of rounds.
It further allows multiple users on the same server to sign in using a given draft's code and participate in or spectate the draft.

This app lets clients create, save and edit geometric art by repeatedly breaking up a square into quadrants and customizing their respective colors.

This app displays real-time weather information at the client's geolocation, while also letting them get current weather data about any city in the world.
